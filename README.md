# auto10fastfingers

### Objective

My objective with this code is get familiar with Selenium in Python and have some fun.

### What is 10fastfingers and what this program does?

10 fast fingers is a website where we can measure our typing speed by taking a test of 1 min copying a list of words.
The program as the name sugests enters in the 10fastfingers.com site and type the words automaticaly.

The idea is not get top score, is just for getting used to the Selenium package and trying new things.
